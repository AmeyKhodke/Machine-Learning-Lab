# 🧠 Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains a collection of practical lab assignments focused on core **Machine Learning** concepts. Each lab covers a key ML algorithm or topic, implemented using Python and popular libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

These labs are designed to provide hands-on experience and help you understand how machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated on real datasets.
